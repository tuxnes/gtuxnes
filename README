GTuxNES README

What is GTuxNES?
-----------------
GTuxNES is a graphical launcher for the Nintendo Emulator TuxNES.  TuxNES
is entirely command line based and I got tired of typing the dozen options
I wanted to use every time I started the emulator.  So my response was to
build GTuxNES.  GTuxNES is built using GTK libraries version 1.2.8.


Can I use GTuxNES?
-------------------
Sure!  All you need is to get and install the GTK libraries from
http://www.gtk.org/.  Then go get the development TuxNES from
http://tuxnes.sourceforge.net/.  Once you've compiled and installed
that, GTuxNES should work for you.


Where does GTuxNES look for the TuxNES binary?
-----------------------------------------------
As long as the tuxnes binary is located in one of the directories in your
PATH environment variable and is called 'tuxnes' GTuxNES will have no
problem finding it.  If you get any weirdness, putting the 'tuxnes' binary
in the same directory as 'gtuxnes' should solve your problem.


Where does GTuxNES store the config options?
---------------------------------------------
Right now, it looks for the config file in your home directory (as returned
by g_get_home_dir()) and uses the filename '.gtuxnesrc'.  A future release
will hopefully add support for use of multiple config files, specifiable
on the command line.


What happened to the 'Save Config' button?
-------------------------------------------
I decided between versions 0.3.0 and 0.75 (which are actually consecutive
versions, despite their wide numerical spread) that it made more sense to
just make GTuxNES auto-save the config file whenever it exited, rather than
forcing the user to manually save whenever a change was made.  So the 'Save
Config' button has kind of merged into the 'Quit' button.  Every time you
exit GTuxNES it will quietly save the current configuration to ~/.gtuxnesrc.


What does 'x' option do?
-------------------------
A future version of GTuxNES may include a help document that explains
every option available.  For now though, your best bet is to check the
README file in the TuxNES archive.


GTuxNES doesn't work!  You suck!
---------------------------------
Hmm.  That's unfortunate.  Well, if you think you've found a bug, by all
means let me know.  Feel free to fix the bug yourself if you like, then
submit a new Issue or Pull Request at <https://github.com/tuxnes/gtuxnes>.

If you just have something against me, please direct your comments to
your local bit-bucket.


GTuxNES is the coolest thing since sliced bread!
-------------------------------------------------
Well I'm not sure it's *that* cool, but thank you!  Feel free to email me

How is GTuxNES licensed?
--------------------------
GTuxNES is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).  Please
see the file COPYING which you should have received with this archive for
the complete text of the GPL.


Would you like to plug anything?

Well, now that you mention it :)
